### these are the files for the Aunix Linux distro

## Building to an .iso file
to build the .iso file please make sure you are on an Arch or Arch-based distro and have mkarchiso installed then run:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/aunixOS/aunix-files
```
then:
```sh
sudo mkarchiso -v -w /tmp/aunix-tmp ~/aunix-files 
```
this will put the .iso file in ~/out
## Installing
This operating system is meant to be untracable running from a USB stick, so there is no installer on it, please DO NOT INSTALL Aunix onto a computer as this defeats the whole idea of what I am trying to do.

## Issues
if you have an issue please open an issue, I will get around to it eventually

## Chat
The offical chat (as dictated by me) is at:
```
irc.anonops.com
```
accept self signed certs or invalid certs
the port is 6697
the channel is #aunix (very creative I know)
